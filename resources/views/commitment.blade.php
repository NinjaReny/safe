                    We are an academy within the community and we have a direct impact on the local economy, the safety and security, the upkeep and sustainability of our surrounds, infrastructure, attractiveness and the uplifting and improving on general conditions.
                    We know that everyday kindnesses, courtesy, respect, tolerance and care towards everyone in our community can make a positive and lasting difference in our society and on the environment.

More than this, we know that the actions we do today have a ripple effect and impacts on our future.

                    As the world makes the transition to a clean energy future, sustainability is clearly a primary ingredient and priority in driving future economic growth. In fact, the adoption of sustainable measures across industries to reduce carbon emissions can save the global economy an estimated $26 trillion by 2030. The global finance industry needs to contribute.

                    Examining long-term sustainability of money is one way we can contribute. Most currencies today aren’t environmentally friendly, with the production and movement of money contributing to pollution, deforestation and a large carbon footprint.
